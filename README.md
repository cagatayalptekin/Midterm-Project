This is my thesis for Yildiz Technical University Computer Engineering Department. 
In this project, a desktop application has been developed to assist dentists and technicians in error detection in panoramic dental X-ray images. 
The application performs object detection and classification using several models trained on a dataset of approximately 1500 x-ray images. Mandible gets detected by YOLOv8 model and the mandible is binary classified and it is determined whether the x-ray is faulty or faultless. If it is found to be incorrect, the error type is determined by multiple classification. 
The detailed report of the project is available in the repo. Also, don't forget that we had a really small database, so the accuracy rate is about %65
